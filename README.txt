Hello, this is the Unity programming test README.
In here I am writing all the info you will need to know about the project, the how and why of some of the systems and the duration of the developemnt.

I am using Unity 2020.3.25f1


After the initial set up of the scene I decided to work on task 2 and 3. I initially used the Vector3.Dot but I didn't have all the info I was looking for.
So I checked online and I found Vector3.SignedAngle (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.SignedAngle.html). I decided to implenment this instead and it was exactly what I was looking for.
I gave an ACCELLERATION="2000 to all the cars because I needed a constant Speed, then I limited it via the MaxSpeed variable.  


I have never done a Particles before. I did tweak some in the past but never created one, so I decided to get some inspiration from this tutorial(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mw6NpSEb2o)

I created a sptireAtlas with all the used textures for the Particles in order to slighlty reduce the memory usage.
I checked the frame debugger and I saw that the PlayArea shadow was creating 6 more batches, so I baked the shadows of the PlayArea.

I also created an Indicator to help the player remembering what was the last selected point.
There is also an AudioManager that fires Audio Clip when the money are collected or when the Traffic collides with the Player.
In the Managers/GameManager in the scene there is a toggle for a drifting mode, if it is ON (my advice is to reduce the MaxSpeed of the Player to 10 in the SpawnableObjects),
I leave the physics do it's job and make the car drifiting a lot(super fun).
